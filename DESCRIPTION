Description: Estimating causal effects from observational studies. Implemented
    methods include inverse probability of treatment weights estimator of ATE.
    This package uses the geex package for estimation and for its API
    functionality to obtain the empirical sandwich variance estimator using 
    standard estimating equation theory.
