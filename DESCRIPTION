Description: Estimating causal effects from observational studies. Implemented
    methods include inverse probability of treatment weights, and parametric
    G-formula. This package uses the geex package for estimation and for its API
    functionality to obtain the empirical sandwich variance estimator using 
    standard estimating equation theory.
